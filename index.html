    <h1>Neil Warren-Bancquart</h1>
    <p>I'm not sure I know what I'm doing, but at least I'm doing something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Send cold emails. There's always something to say or do.</li>
        <li>Ship now. ~ 50% won't respond, but that's not a bad ratio.</li>
        <li>Work on projects. It's just you and your future self.</li>
        <li>You're allowed to do a lot of things. Bouncing off the world is data-rich.</li>
        <li>I am open to trade. Better than "extracurricular activities".</li>
        <li>My newsletter. Learn to finish something.</li>
        <li>My LessWrong. Often you won't do interesting things because you didn't know you could.</li>
        <li>My website. If you're good at something, email me at neil m warren [at] gmail.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I trade favors and money</p>
